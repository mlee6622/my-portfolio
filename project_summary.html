            For my final project, I decided to create a personal portfolio website. As mentioned in my project proposal, I wanted my website to have a minimalistic and sleek design, which is why the primary colors I used in the website were black, white, and grey. The overall layout of the website is also grid-like and clean. The primary purpose of this website is for people to know more about me and my projects. Additionally, I also created a contact page, where people can reach out with any questions they may have.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some features that I utilized in this project include a form as well as various transitions and transformations. In my contact page, I created a contact submission form where people can enter their personal information and connect with me. Upon submitting the form, they will be brought to a confirmation page with navigations to help them return to the home page. For transitions and transformations, they were applied to buttons in the navigation menu, different buttons present on webpage, and self portraits.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I had a lot of fun creating my personal website and it felt rewarding being able to implement skills I learned from class. I hope to continue using these knowledge I gained to build and design more creative websites in the future.
